            <h3>Africa is short for "Afriga": Africa. There are many interesting legends about the origin of the word Africa: a legend is that in ancient times there was also a chief named Africus, who invaded North Africa in 2000 BC, where a city called Afrikyah was founded, and later known as Afriga. Another legend is that "Afriga" is the name of a goddess revered by the Berbers living in North Africa. The goddess is a patron saint who is said to have discovered a statue of the goddess in a temple as early as the 1st century BC, a young woman in a elephant skin. Since then, the name of the goddess "Afriga" has been used as the name of the African continent. Another theory is that the word africa comes from the Latin word aprica, meaning "sunshine" and is indeed much hotter in North Africa than in Greece and Rome on the northern shores of the Mediterranean.</h3>
